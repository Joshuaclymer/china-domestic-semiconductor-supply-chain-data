### Data collection procedure

I used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to collect this data from online sources. I asked Claude to collect quotes from specific websites (ideally primary sources such as investor reports released by Chinese companies). These quotes and source urls are located at `china.csv` and `world.csv`.

The following is the prompt that I provided to Claude Sonnet 4.5:


```
I want you to help me document how the capabilities of China's domestic semiconductor supply chain have improved over time.

I'm specifically interested in the timeline of China's indigenously produced [tool]. I am only interested in [tools] that are produced almost entirely indigenously, with little imported parts or outsourcing.

I'm going to ask you to consider each of the following transistor node processes: 180 nm, 90 nm, 45 nm, 28 nm, 14 nm, and 7 nm.

For each of these processes, I want you to indicate when the following two milestones were achieved, or if they were never achieved: 
1. Pilot. The tool passed validation, or was described as fully functional.
2. HVM ready. The tool could be used to process thousands of wafers per month if all other tools were adequate.

You may assume that quadruple multi-patterning is economically viable. For example, in some cases, 28 nm immersion DUV can be used to effectively achieve 7 nm with quadruple multi-patterning. Also, please provide your assessment assuming *all other tools* in the supply chain are sufficient for achieving the provided node. So you are essentially aswering the question: "suppose a state of the art fab that can achieve N nm process was forced to use Chinese domestically produced [tool] from X year," could they still achieve an N nm process?

Please format your answer as a markdown table like so:

| 180 nm | 90 nm | 45 nm | 28 nm | 14 nm | 7 nm |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| [dates] | [dates] | [dates] | [dates] | [dates] | [dates |

Each cell should be ('[dates]') above should be formatted likes so:
"[pilot year range, or N/A if there was never a pilot]; [HVM ready year range, or N/A if the tools was never HVM ready];[real and correct url of source for pilot year, ideally a primary source];[direct quote from source justifying pilot year range in the original language];[date of source publication];[explanation of why the quote justifies the pilot year and any additional context, such as the name of the first tool that exceeded the milestone, and uncertainties];[your confidence in the provided date, either 'guess,' 'reliable inference,' 'direct quote from secondary source,' or 'direct quote from primary source'];[real and correct url of source for HVM ready year, ideally a primary source];[direct quote from source justifying HVM ready year in the original language];[date of source publication];[explanation of why the quote justifies the pilot year and any additional context, such as the name of the first tool that exceeded the milestone, or uncertainties];[your confidence in the provided date, either 'guess,' 'reliable inference,' 'direct quote from secondary source,' or 'direct quote from primary source']"

In cases where the tool never reached the provided milestone, provide a source that justifies this claim as well. Please avoid guessing. If you do not have a source that indicates the *specific year* a milestone was achieved, please search harder. You may need to look at investor documents written in mandarin and use internet archives.

Here's an example for the tool "DUV scanner":

Now please do extensive reasoning and research, and then provide an analysis of the timeline of the development of [tool], completing your response with a markdown table like the one above.

I read each entry and explanation written by Claude Sonnet 4.5, often asking clarifying questions and suggesting corrections or changes.

Then, I performed a spot check of several entries to verify that:
1. The url was valid.
2. The url included the provided quote.

Then, to acquire data on global semiconductor capabilities, I applied a similar process with a modified prompt:

```
I want you to help me document how the semiconductor manufacturing industry has advanced over time—specifically, how [tools] have advanced.

Please consider each of the following transistor-node processes: 180 nm, 90 nm, 45 nm, 28 nm, 14 nm, and 7 nm.

For each of these processes, indicate when the following two milestones were achieved (or state that they were never achieved):
1. **Pilot**: The tool passed validation or was described as fully functional.
2. **HVM-ready**: The tool could be used to process thousands of wafers per month if all other tools were adequate.

You may assume that quadruple multi-patterning is economically viable. For example, in some cases, 28 nm immersion DUV can be used to effectively achieve 7 nm with quadruple multi-patterning. Also provide your assessment assuming *all other tools* in the supply chain are sufficient for achieving the given node. In other words, answer the question: “Suppose a state-of-the-art fab that can achieve an N nm process was forced to use [tool] from year X—could it still achieve an N nm process?”

Format your answer as a Markdown table like this:

|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|

Each cell (the “[dates]” above) must be formatted exactly like this (single line, semicolon-separated):
“[pilot year range, or N/A if there was never a pilot]; [HVM-ready year range, or N/A if the tool was never HVM-ready]; [real and correct URL of the source for the pilot year, ideally a primary source]; [direct quote from the source justifying the pilot year range in the original language]; [date of source publication]; [explanation of why the quote justifies the pilot year and any additional context, such as the name of the first tool that exceeded the milestone, and uncertainties]; [your confidence in the provided date, either ‘guess,’ ‘reliable inference,’ ‘direct quote from secondary source,’ or ‘direct quote from primary source’]; [real and correct URL of the source for the HVM-ready year, ideally a primary source]; [direct quote from the source justifying the HVM-ready year in the original language]; [date of source publication]; [explanation of why the quote justifies the HVM-ready year and any additional context, such as the name of the first tool that exceeded the milestone, or uncertainties]; [your confidence in the provided date, either ‘guess,’ ‘reliable inference,’ ‘direct quote from secondary source,’ or ‘direct quote from primary source’]”

Please avoid guessing. If you do not have a source that indicates the *specific year* a milestone was achieved, search more thoroughly. You may need to consult investor documents and use the Internet Archive.

### Limitations

I am not an expert in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. My knowledge extends not far beyond high level descriptions of how the components documented in this data function. I investigated the nature of the semiconductor supply chain, and it's history, for approximately one week before creating this dataset.

Also, I do not speak Chinese languages, and largely deferred the translation of Chinese sources (which were a substantial fraction of the source websites) to Claude Sonnet 4.5.

Therefore, I expect there to be numerous mistakes in this data; however, I expect that the overall trend that it reflects is accurate.

I sanity checked some of the claims by reading the analysis of well regarded experts, and they seem to line up fairly well.
